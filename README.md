## Title: Analyzing Airline Performance Data using SAS
In this data analytics project, we will analyze airline performance data using SAS. The dataset used in this project contains information about various airlines, including attributes such as length, speed, daily flight time, population served, operating costs, revenue, and more. We will perform data cleaning, calculate a rating based on operating costs, visualize the rating distribution, find the fastest plane, and filter airlines whose names start with 'P'.
